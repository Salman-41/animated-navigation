# Animated Navigation

This is a simple project for creating an animated navigation menu for your website. It provides an interactive and visually appealing way for users to navigate through different sections of your webpage. The menu can be triggered by clicking on a "hamburger" menu icon, and it slides in from the side with a smooth animation. Each navigation item is highlighted with a different color, and the text is accompanied by a sliding underline on hover.
